        <p>Wait a minute, I said I wanted simple, but not boring. 
            What is up with this design? There's nothing on it but 
            white space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not 
            what i had in mind. The type is all in Helvetica, which i like , 
            but it doesn"t excite me at all. There is just no character to 
            anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla.
            I really need something to grab the attention of a visitor to
            the site and this just doesn"t do it.
